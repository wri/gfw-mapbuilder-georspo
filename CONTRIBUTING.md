2. Ensure your commits pass `npm test` which runs `eslint src/js/**/*.js`.
3. Test as much as possible to ensure nothiing broke, we will pull the code down and test before accepting.
4. If you are pushing CSS changes, make sure to test the 2 latest versions of all major browsers (`Chrome`, `Safari`, `Firefox`, and `Edge`) before submitting a pull request.

### Conventions
These are not required but we would be appreciate it if you tried your best to adhere to them.

#### Branch Names
We try to use feature branch names and not generic names.  So use something like `update/languages` or `fix/loss-analysis` instead of things like `johndoe` or `johndoe/updates`.

#### Submitting a PR
Please include a brief description of what you are fixing, updating, or adding to the project so we know what to look for when reviewing.
